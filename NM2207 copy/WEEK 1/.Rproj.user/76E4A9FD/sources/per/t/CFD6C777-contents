##Picture

```{r, out.height= "800px",out.width= "600px",echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig.cap="Picture"}
knitr::include_graphics("linkedin.JPG")
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
